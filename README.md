# Movies Finder App ðŸŽ¬

This is a movie search web application that allows users to search for movies and view details about each movie.

-   Bookmarks: Bookmark your favorite movies to view later.
-   Recently Viewed Movies: Users can also come back to recently viewed movies.
-   Responsive Design: The web app is designed to look and function well on different screen sizes.
